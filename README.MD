Hello! This is a modeling program, as you may have guessed!

This program allows you to create a 3d model, then load it back at a later time. To do this, simplyl hover over a cube and hit the 'u' key. This will save the data. To refresh the data, simply delete everything inside the locations.txt file. The rest is handled automatically.

This will give you a base. You can also simply type in the co-ordinates of the cubes if you wish. Best of luck!

Side note:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should set you up. More bugfixes coming soon!
