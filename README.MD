Hello! This is a modeling program, as you may have guessed!

This program allows you to create a 3d model, then load it back at a later time. To do this, simplyl hover over a cube and hit the 'u' key. This will save the data. To refresh the data, simply delete everything inside the locations.txt file and then type in one thing: (0, 0, 0)

This will give you a base. You can also simply type in the co-ordinates of the cubes if you wish. Best of luck!

Side note:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should set you up. More bugfixes coming soon!
